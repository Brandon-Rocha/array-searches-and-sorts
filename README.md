 * COP 3530: Project 1 â€“ Array Searches and Sorts  
 * Project1 starts by asking for a file input, in this case it is Countries1.csv file. If given a file that does not exist it will terminate.
 * After the file is accepted it parses the information from the file using commas and \n as delimiters. 
 * Once it has parsed two strings and five doubles, it will create a Country object and add it to an array of Country objects(cArray[])
 * Once the array of Country objects is created, it will repeatedly print a menu correlating to integers.
 * Options 1-6 are actions to be performed while 7 allows the user to quit and will terminate the program.
 * 
 * More details are given by the static methods documented later. It is important to note that menu option 1 calls method option1(), 
 * menu option 2 calls method option2(), etc.
